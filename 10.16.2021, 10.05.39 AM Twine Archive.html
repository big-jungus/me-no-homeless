The world around you is in a medieval era, with knights, lords and such, yet you are just an average teen in an average village.
The village has not seen war for generations, making your life extremely peaceful, with only few hardships. In recent years, the village has seen a surplus of crops, leaving no one hungry. Young children aren&#39;t needed to help make ends meet, leaving them plenty of free time to have a childhood.
You have recently come of age, which requires you to begin helping out adults around the village. Currently its harvest season, one of the busiest times of the year.
Your parents are out on the [[fields]], busy making sure there&#39;s plenty to eat for the winter.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="fields" tags="" position="760,183.5" size="100,100">You go to help out your parents, as well as other families harvest the crops in time.

You speak to your father, making sure that there isn&#39;t anything else that needs to be done for the day.
